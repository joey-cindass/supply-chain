# Executive Summary
## Project Overview
Declining profitability caused by operational inefficiencies, poor resource allocation, and excessive spending has reduced the company’s financial performance. This analysis evaluates end-to-end supply chain performance to uncover actionable insights across transportation efficiency, supplier reliability, and regional revenue optimization. Using Excel for data analysis and visualization, I measured the companies current cost efficiency, lead-time performance, and profitability. The goal was to identify inefficiencies, highlight cost-saving opportunities, and recommend strategies to enhance overall supply chain. 

## Business Problem
To maximize profit and reduce waste, leadership needs to optimize operations and sales by prioritizing high-performing vendors and regions. Profit margins have declined and may miss future benchmarks. The company seeks to identify whether inefficiencies lie within operations, sales, supplier selection, or regional performance.

## Objectives 
- Evaluate operational efficiency: Evaluate Air, Rail, Road, and Sea shipping methods using cost, lead-time, and utilization metrics to identify the most efficient logistics routes.
- Evaluate Supplier Performance: Assess five suppliers on profitability, defect rates, and delivery performance to determine sourcing efficiency and quality consistency.
- Evaluate Regional Operations: Analyze revenue distribution and shipping times across cities to highlight strong performers and underperforming regions.

## Key Findings
- Sea transport emerged as the most efficient mode — 10.4% cheaper and 3.9% faster than the overall average — but remains underutilized.
- Supplier 1 accounted for 27% of total profit and achieved the lowest defect rate (1.8%), making it the benchmark for procurement efficiency.
- Mumbai generated 24% of total revenue with one of the shortest lead times (5.55 days), signaling operational excellence.
- Skincare products produced 42% of overall sales revenue, while Cosmetics offered higher margins but lower order volume.

## Tools and Skills
- Excel: Visualizations, PivotTables, Data Cleaning, Dashboarding

## Recommendations
- Reallocate volume toward Sea shipping to reduce logistics costs and improve delivery times.
- Centralize purchases with top-performing suppliers to strengthen quality and profitability.
- Use Mumbai’s operational framework as a model for other regions.
- Prioritize high-demand product lines such as Skincare and premium Cosmetics to sustain growth.
