# Executive Summary
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a company’s end-to-end supply chain performance to uncover actionable insights on transportation efficiency, supplier reliability, and regional revenue optimization. Using Excel for data analysis and visualization, I developed metrics that quantify cost efficiency, lead-time performance, and profitability across multiple operational layers.

The primary goal was to identify inefficiencies, reveal cost-saving opportunities, and propose strategies that improve overall supply chain responsiveness and profitability.

## Objectives 
Evaluate operational efficiency: Evaluate Air, Rail, Road, and Sea shipping methods using cost, lead-time, and utilization metrics to identify the most efficient logistics routes.
Evaluate Supplier Performance: Assess five suppliers on profitability, defect rates, and delivery performance to determine sourcing efficiency and quality consistency.
Evaluate Regional Operations: Analyze revenue distribution and shipping times across cities to highlight strong performers and underperforming regions.

## Key Findings
- Sea transport emerged as the most efficient mode — 10.4% cheaper and 3.9% faster than the overall average — but remains underutilized.
- Supplier 1 accounted for 27% of total profit and achieved the lowest defect rate (1.8%), making it the benchmark for procurement efficiency.
- Mumbai generated 24% of total revenue with one of the shortest lead times (5.55 days), signaling operational excellence.
- Skincare products produced 42% of overall sales revenue, while Cosmetics offered higher margins but lower order volume.
